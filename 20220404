  Verify Figma Access is under dowjones. TRUE!
  Received invitation to GitHub, setup account for dow jones.
  Computer request moving forward (Unlikely to be delivered this week).
  Asked if we could meet later (Myself, Tina, possibly Helen) to align on vision/goals for Unified Design System. A single design or platform flavored (Material, HIG, Web)? Create notes for Helen.
  Also, bring up Single Design vs. Platform Specific in 11am meeting "Kevin/NewsKit team meet up".
  Want to include Shadowing to help onboard process.
  Tina mentions teams prefer to use Figma for SSOT design documentation.
