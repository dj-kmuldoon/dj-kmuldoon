10PM
• [TASK] 970px wide ads in 12col Grids
Shared videos with Team,  Paul, Min and others. I believe change from 960 viewport to 980 viewport as breakpoint for 12col is good.

NOTES:

Good meet on Design System Deep Dive. Like the Typography angle for name of DS Team
Theme swapper is problematic for access to GitHub. Will work with Amy to figure out why/how this happened. And, get a tech solution to remove this friction.
