9:00AM - Looked through WorkDay Org Chart
        Replied to Interface Inventory question from Tina (Live Coverage vs. Newsletter Sign-up).

10:00AM - MEETING: NewsKit Design System - Design drop in clinic.
                • Asked for access to Figma Plugin code in GitHub. Luke Finch https://www.figma.com/@Finch is the man. 
                • NK said they'd follow up and connect Luke and myself for access.
        – Setup 1:1 with Mike Messina for tomorrow
        
11:00AM – MEETING: Component tasks
        – Create a Figma implementation on Newsletter signup (Will hold until connect with Surendar to get best practises)
        – How to document components. What platform? 
                • Storybook (Possibly!)
                • Confluence (Users say too complicated)
                • ZeroHeight (Great, but expensive. $49 per editor. No budget.)
                • Jira (Free. Need to setup team and access permissions. May not be visible to everyone.)
                • Miro (Not sure if right tool)
                • supernova.io (Similar to ZeroHeight, but cheaper. $25 per editor. Not quite as nice for documentation.)
                • Notion (Very affordable) https://www.notion.so/product/notion-for-design
        
11:30AM – MEETING: NK-Popover Component Chat
