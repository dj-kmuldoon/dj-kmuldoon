		CONSIDER WORKFLOW and STRUCTURE
			– Our goal is ADOPTION, ADOPTION, ADOPTION
			(note, this is OUR goal. Internal. externally we list different goals to users where they see benefits and problems solved)
			– Know that our DS will serve two different needs of designers. "Pick up an existing component" customers and "I need to build from scratch" customers. We'll NEVER have 100% components, so must serve both users.
			– PERHAPS  align stakeholders of different brands early in component creation (Round table of experts of brands), negotiate on what they can live with and what is absolutly essential. Make 20 varients into a more manageable 3-5, if feasible.
