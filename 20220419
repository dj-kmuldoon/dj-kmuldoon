• Connected with Amy on normalized WSG colors, so we can have a conversation with Sebastian tomorrow.
	– Luke Finch created 'meaningfully weighted' ramps.
		• Weight 050 is pass for 3:1 WCAG on "#FFFFFF"
		• Weight 060 is pass for 4.5:1 WCAG on "#FFFFFF"
	– When making ramps for WSJ, Barrons, MORE, we should adhere to meaningful *L values defined in NK
		• Helps accessibility (A11y)
		• Communicates to designers/engineers the 'right' weight to choose (or ignore, if they choose)
		• The 'right' color for accessibility is not handled by UDS. They must interface with brand/designers (not us in the middle).
	– I mentioned colors can be annotated in 'description' in Figma, which is searchable. 
		• If designer prefers to find a color by 'definitive name'. they can search 'dark-yellow' and find 'alert-080' is the correct key/value in Figma
	– UDS values ensuring colors are 'tokenized' in a logical NK fashion, and allow brand/design to quickly search for 'their' defined colors
		• Propose prefixing 'description' of all defined/approved brand colors with a special character so they can list all colors.
• Created a Figma file to define presentation standards.
	– Agree 16:9 ratio on videos, slides, presentations.
• Continued setup of iShowU for good quality and 16:9 ratio capture (prep for 'Text Cropper' video)
• Told Amy I will invite her all meetings I create with Stakeholders, designers, etc. 
	– I'll tag optional if not super important.
• Will continue with video setup and creation of 'Text Cropper' video.	


STRUCTURAL NEEDS FOR UDS
	• Dedicated Confluence Site for UDS
		– Need a place to put documentation (if only we could spring for ZeroHeight)
			• POTENTIAL PROBLEM: Does everyone have access to our Confluence? Without friction?
	• Dedicated Jira board	
	• Dedicated Slack channel (I know we have one, too many people in group?)
	• Access to NK documentation? Copy/paste where it makes sense?
