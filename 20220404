  Verified Figma Access is under dowjones. Yes, under kevin.muldoon@dowjones.com
  Received invitation to GitHub, setup account for dow jones.
  Computer request moving forward (won't be delivered this week).
  Asked if we could meet later (Myself, Tina, possibly Helen) to align on vision/goals for Unified Design System. A single design or platform flavored (Material, HIG, Web)? Create notes for Helen.
  Also, bring up Single Design vs. Platform Specific in 11am meeting "Kevin/NewsKit team meet up".
  Want to include Shadowing to help onboard process.
  Tina mentions teams prefer to use Figma for SSOT design documentation.
  
10:00AM – Research/Discovery
  Vincent Rickey Slacked examples of Jetpack Compose he's working on for mobile support.
    Q: "What is Jetpack Compose?" - A UI Framework for Android. Similar to SwiftUI.
  Do not have access to GitHub repo, but replied in Slack for access for dj-kmuldoon. Screenshots provided which I've reviewed.

REST OF DAY...
  Setup 1:1 with Ellis Capon for tomorrow morning
  Catchup with Tina @3PM
  More in-depth with Jetpack, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvDo0SKR8-k (I don't know if/how StyleDictionary integrates with this. Discovery process).
  Sent invite to Tina on Vision of Unified Design System.
  Meeting with Amy – her perspective on the combo of Factiva/NewsKit. Where they align and diverge.
  
  
THOUGHTS/OBSERVATIONS
  Are thinking of the Design System as simply a collection of components. This is useful and important but shouldn't a design system allow users
  freedom to create their own designs? DataViz, infographics, illustrations. Hero pages? 
  
ACCESS REQUEST
  Like to get full access to all brands Dow Jones supports on web/mobile.
