          	– Presented color ramps and how Lucas Finch is approaching with L* weights. 
          	– Advantages to WCAG communication (incidental vs. essential colors)
          	– A lot of colors, how do we avoid choosing the wrong color demonstrated.
          	– Supporting dark-mode.
          	– Presented my program which creates color ramps automatically. Showed how it maps to NewsKit.
          	– Amy suggests presenting how theme-swapper works to larger audience (lots of enthusiasm)
          	– TAKE AWAY: Sebastian tasked to create color semantic names that make best sense.

11:00AM
	• [MEETING] Confluence site planning, Tina Nixon
		– Purpose of 'Design System Program' (https://dowjones.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DE/overview?homepageId=2569437376). 
			• High level stakeholders (non-single contributors) are informed and understand what UDS does for organization.
			• Define values, principles.
			• Define process and workflow (How we do things)
			• IS NOT a DSM (Documentation of components). Internal only.
		– Design Documentation is worth a steal
		– Tina likes Paragon Design System
	• [TASK] Play with Confluence, create pages (for mobile), take notes, make comments
	• Sharon offers Confluence training – I want.
	• I know what UXA means (User Experience Architect)
	• "CONNECT WITH MOBILE ENGINEERING"
		– Communicated I feel blocked. 
			• Tue Apr 12 – I reached out to Vincent Ricky for a meeting "DJ-UDS & Design Tokens")
			• Collected feedback and created a deck, presented with Tina/Sharon. 
				– Key take aways: Vincent has no plans to use NewsKit. Is unsure of areas of responsibility (who owns what)
			• Fri Apr 15, 2022 – Presented with Tina/Sharon	'Unified Design Tokens' in response to Vincents directions/questions. https://www.figma.com/file/hVBBQ5UOxZ6ubgeoHclOCl/DJDS-%E2%80%93-White-label-tokens?node-id=2%3A814
				– PROPOSED: Unified Design System Team takes ownership of Figma library files, and responsibility for naming, output and hosting of tokens to support both NK as well as StyleDictionary for Mobile Nextgen.
				– KEY: Sharon to connect with Clarence. Sharon Slacks Tina/Kevin that Clarence is OOO until next week.
				-MY PERSONAL TAKE AWAY: Take no further action with Mobile Engineering until Leadership has connected, and design-token ownership is communicated to wider team.
