10:00AM 
	• Meeting Luke/James, technical things of DK
		"Hello Luke, James!

"Hey this is Kevin! I'm the new Design Technologist for Dow Jones Unified Design System under Tina Nixon. 
I've been reaching out to NK team-members for 1:1s and it's been great to meet/greet the team. Everyone mentions you 
as primary drivers of Figma/Web/CLI implementations of NewsKit Design System so it would be great to get together.
Hope to get some time to meet both of you and get the big picture of how design and engineering interfaces with NK for Dow Jones. 
We have an opportunity to make sure this initiative works as smoothly as possible so lets take advantage!"

		– Color system for NK is agnostic to token name of 'primitive' token names. i.e 'blue060' could be named 'whatchamacallit'. The render only references the 'contextual' names of colors.
		– There is a plan to incorporate StyleDictionary into NK. Completion months down road. I'm not sure when they start building.
		– Luke uses HSLUV color model, built from CIE. We are completely aligned with L* functionality for generating ramps.
