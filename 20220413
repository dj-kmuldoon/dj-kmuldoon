		• Yesterday
			
	  – TASK: Met James Spenser and Luke Finch  [DONE]
		    • There is a plan to incorporate StyleDictionary into NK. Completion months down road. I'm not sure when they start building.
		    • Color system for NK is agnostic to token name of 'primitive' token names. i.e 'blue060' could be named 'whatchamacallit'. The render only references the 'contextual' names of colors.        
		    • Luke uses HSLUV color model, built from CIE. We are completely aligned with L* functionality for generating ramps.
    – Luke sent excel file describing 'primitive colors' for NK. 
      • I have a tool that can auto-generate to match his schema and weights.
