 • [TRAINING] – "News Corp Sexual Harassment and Retaliation" -
	– I learned "the Connecticut Discrimination Employment Practices Act prohibits sexual harassment. In June 2019, Connecticut enacted the “Time’s Up Act,” requiring all employers with three or more employees to provide two hours of sexual harassment training to all employees, including those in a non-supervisory position. Employers with fewer than three employees must provide the training only to supervisory employees"
