    • MEETING: "Settings - Interests/Alerts" w/ Scott Jones
        – TOPIC: Meeting to review the new settings component for interests and alerts and align before handoff on Friday. 
        – Subh invited me to this so I get a sense of how Factiva interacts with the larger organization
        – Interesting 'bug' in NK with text fields. Hard to call it a bug, but Scott found friction when attempting to display assistive text underneath text-field.

    • MEETING: "Weekly Touchbase" w/ Amy Nailor
        – Amy will reach out to Jason A11y
        – I brought up the interactive 'unsubscribe' display when unsubscribing via toggle/switch in "Newsletter sign-up". She was aware and will do research today on different brands.
        – Amy asks about scalable text for mobile or compressed responsive treatments. She used to have a Sketch plug-in that handled this. Hmmm!
        – Amy helps me understand the text-field assistive text is not a varient, but set in layers. Explains why Scott had friction. I'd like to make that a varient to prevent in future.
